# glob-watcher

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url] [![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

Watch globs and execute a function upon change, with intelligent defaults for debouncing and queueing.

## Usage

```js
var watch = require('glob-watcher');

watch(['./*.js', '!./something.js'], function (done) {
  // This function will be called each time a globbed file is changed
  // but is debounced with a 200ms delay (default) and queues subsequent calls

  // Make sure to signal async completion with the callback
  // or by returning a stream, promise, observable or child process
  done();

  // if you need access to the `path` or `stat` object, listen
  // for the `change` event (see below)

  // if you need to listen to specific events, use the returned
  // watcher instance (see below)
});

// Raw chokidar instance
var watcher = watch(['./*.js', '!./something.js']);

// Listen for the 'change' event to get `path`/`stat`
// No async completion available because this is the raw chokidar instance
watcher.on('change', function (path, stat) {
  // `path` is the path of the changed file
  // `stat` is an `fs.Stat` object (not always available)
});

// Listen for other events
// No async completion available because this is the raw chokidar instance
watcher.on('add', function (path, stat) {
  // `path` is the path of the changed file
  // `stat` is an `fs.Stat` object (not always available)
});
```

## API

### `watch(globs[, options][, fn])`

Takes a path string, an array of path strings, a [glob][micromatch] string or an array of [glob][micromatch] strings as `globs` to watch on the filesystem. Also optionally takes `options` to configure the watcher and a `fn` to execute when a file changes.

**Note: As of 5.0.0, globs must use `/` as the separator character because `\\` is reserved for escape sequences (as per the Bash 4.3 & Micromatch specs). This means you can't use `path.join()` or `**dirname`in Windows environments. If you need to use`path.join()`, you can use [normalize-path][normalize-path] against your paths afterwards. If you need to use `**dirname`, you can set it as the `cwd` option that gets passed directly to [chokidar][chokidar]. The [micromatch docs][micromatch-backslashes] contain more information about backslashes.**

Returns an instance of [chokidar][chokidar].

#### `fn([callback])`

If the `fn` is passed, it will be called when the watcher emits a `change`, `add` or `unlink` event. It is automatically debounced with a default delay of 200 milliseconds and subsequent calls will be queued and called upon completion. These defaults can be changed using the `options`.

The `fn` is passed a single argument, `callback`, which is a function that must be called when work in the `fn` is complete. Instead of calling the `callback` function, [async completion][async-completion] can be signalled by:

- Returning a `Stream` or `EventEmitter`
- Returning a `Child Process`
- Returning a `Promise`
- Returning an `Observable`

Once async completion is signalled, if another run is queued, it will be executed.

#### `options`

##### `options.ignoreInitial`

If set to `false` the `fn` is called during [chokidar][chokidar] instantiation as it discovers the file paths. Useful if it is desirable to trigger the `fn` during startup.

**Passed through to [chokidar][chokidar], but defaulted to `true` instead of `false`.**
